If you click a lot you can develop a wonderful bouquet of numbers that leave wooly trails.  The rotation speed is roughly set at the number displayed, in degrees per second.\r\n\r\n**Press R** to switch the rotation units between _radians per second_ and _degrees per second_.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nOriginated as a demo of some object-oriented stuff by Tristan Miller (@tristanmiller) in 2014. The idea was developed further in a late-night pro-jam in Hackney Wick with Leo and Nick.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
